## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-db-migration-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Set specific resource names
export SQL_SERVER_NAME="sqlserver-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export SQL_DATABASE_NAME="modernized-db"
export DMS_SERVICE_NAME="dms-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME="stgmigration${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export BACKUP_VAULT_NAME="rsv-backup-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOG_ANALYTICS_NAME="la-monitoring-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create resource group
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=database-migration environment=demo

echo "✅ Resource group created: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"

# Create Log Analytics workspace for monitoring
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --workspace-name ${LOG_ANALYTICS_NAME} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --sku PerGB2018

echo "✅ Log Analytics workspace created for monitoring"
```

## Steps

       --name ${SQL_SERVER_NAME} \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --admin-user sqladmin \
       --admin-password "ComplexP@ssw0rd123!" \
       --enable-public-network true
   
   # Create Azure SQL Database
   az sql db create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --server ${SQL_SERVER_NAME} \
       --name ${SQL_DATABASE_NAME} \
       --service-objective S2 \
       --backup-storage-redundancy Local
   
   # Configure firewall to allow Azure services
   az sql server firewall-rule create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --server ${SQL_SERVER_NAME} \
       --name AllowAzureServices \
       --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 \
       --end-ip-address 0.0.0.0
   
   echo "✅ Azure SQL Database created and configured"
   ```

   The Azure SQL Database is now ready as the migration target with appropriate security configurations. This foundational step establishes the modern, cloud-native database platform that will host your migrated data with enhanced scalability, security, and built-in high availability features.

2. **Create Storage Account for Migration Assets**:

   Azure Storage provides secure, durable storage for database backup files and migration assets during the modernization process. The storage account serves as an intermediary location for database backups and migration logs, ensuring data integrity and providing audit trails throughout the migration process.

       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --sku Standard_LRS \
       --kind StorageV2 \
       --access-tier Hot \
       --https-only true
   
   # Create container for database backups
   az storage container create \
       --name database-backups \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --public-access off
   
   # Get storage account key for later use
   STORAGE_KEY=$(az storage account keys list \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --account-name ${STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME} \
       --query '[0].value' --output tsv)
   
   echo "✅ Storage account created for migration assets"
   ```

   The storage account is configured with secure access and dedicated containers for migration assets. This centralized storage approach ensures that all migration artifacts are properly organized and accessible to the Database Migration Service while maintaining security best practices.

3. **Create Database Migration Service Instance**:

   Azure Database Migration Service orchestrates the entire migration process, providing assessment capabilities, schema migration, and data transfer with minimal downtime.

This step establishes the framework for transferring schema, data, and database objects while maintaining referential integrity and minimizing downtime during the migration process.

   ```bash
   # Create migration project
   az dms project create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --service-name ${DMS_SERVICE_NAME} \
       --name "sqlserver-to-azuresql-migration" \
       --source-platform SQL \
       --target-platform SQLDB \
       --location ${LOCATION}
   
   # Create connection info for source (simulated on-premises)
   SOURCE_CONNECTION_INFO='{
       "dataSource": "source-server.contoso.com",
       "serverName": "source-server",
       "authentication": "SqlAuthentication",
       "userName": "sourceuser",
       "password": "SourceP@ssw0rd123!",
       "encryptConnection": true,
       "trustServerCertificate": true
   }'
   
   # Create connection info for target Azure SQL Database
   TARGET_CONNECTION_INFO='{
       "dataSource": "'${SQL_SERVER_NAME}'.database.windows.net",
       "serverName": "'${SQL_SERVER_NAME}'",
       "authentication": "SqlAuthentication",
       "userName": "sqladmin",
       "password": "ComplexP@ssw0rd123!",
       "encryptConnection": true,

       --name "migration-alerts" \
       --short-name "migration" \
       --email-receiver name="admin" email="admin@contoso.com"
   
   # Create metric alert for migration failures
   az monitor metrics alert create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name "migration-failure-alert" \
       --description "Alert for migration failures" \
       --scopes "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.DataMigration/services/${DMS_SERVICE_NAME}" \
       --condition "count static > 0" \
       --action-group "migration-alerts" \
       --evaluation-frequency 1m \
       --window-size 5m
   
   # Enable diagnostic settings for DMS
   az monitor diagnostic-settings create \
       --resource "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP}/providers/Microsoft.DataMigration/services/${DMS_SERVICE_NAME}" \
       --name "dms-diagnostics" \

This monitoring infrastructure provides the visibility needed to ensure successful migrations and rapid response to any issues that may arise during the modernization process.

7. **Create Migration Task for Schema Migration**:

   Schema migration transfers database structure, indexes, constraints, and stored procedures from the source to the target database. This critical step ensures that the target database has the proper structure to receive data while maintaining referential integrity and performance characteristics of the original database design.

   ```bash
   # Create schema migration task
   SCHEMA_TASK_CONFIG='{
       "taskType": "Migrate.SqlServer.AzureSqlDb",
       "input": {
           "sourceConnectionInfo": '${SOURCE_CONNECTION_INFO}',
           "targetConnectionInfo": '${TARGET_CONNECTION_INFO}',
           "selectedDatabases": [{
               "name": "AdventureWorks2019",
               "targetDatabaseName": "'${SQL_DATABASE_NAME}'",
               "makeSourceDbReadOnly": false,
               "tableMap": {}
           }]
       }
   }'
   
   # Note: In production, you would create the actual migration task
   # This is a demonstration of the configuration structure
   echo "Schema migration task configuration prepared"
   echo "✅ Schema migration ready for execution"
   ```

   The schema migration task is configured to transfer the complete database structure from source to target. This preparation step ensures that all database objects, relationships, and constraints are properly mapped and ready for migration while maintaining data integrity throughout the process.

8. **Configure Backup Policies and Retention**:

   Automated backup policies ensure that your modernized database maintains comprehensive data protection with customizable retention periods and recovery options.

The architectural approach demonstrated in this recipe follows Azure Well-Architected Framework principles, particularly focusing on reliability and operational excellence. Azure Monitor integration provides comprehensive observability across the entire migration lifecycle, enabling proactive issue resolution and performance optimization. The use of Recovery Services Vault ensures that modernized databases benefit from enterprise-grade backup and disaster recovery capabilities that automatically scale with business needs. For comprehensive monitoring guidance, review the [Azure Monitor documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/) and [Azure Backup best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/guidance-best-practices).

From a business perspective, this modernization approach delivers significant cost optimization through reduced infrastructure overhead, automated maintenance, and elastic scaling capabilities. Azure SQL Database's consumption-based pricing model, combined with automated backup storage optimization, provides predictable costs that scale with actual usage rather than peak capacity planning. The integrated monitoring and alerting system reduces operational overhead while improving system reliability and uptime. For cost optimization strategies, see the [Azure SQL Database pricing guide](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/sql-database/) and [Azure cost management documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/).

> **Tip**: Use Azure Database Migration Assessment tool before migration to identify potential compatibility issues and optimize migration strategies. The assessment provides detailed reports on migration readiness, feature compatibility, and performance recommendations that can significantly improve migration success rates.
