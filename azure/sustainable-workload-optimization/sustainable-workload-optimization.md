# Sustainable Workload Optimization for Carbon Reduction

## Problem

Organizations face increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining operational efficiency and controlling cloud costs. Traditional monitoring approaches only focus on performance and cost metrics, missing the environmental impact of cloud resources. Without automated optimization capabilities, IT teams struggle to identify underutilized resources that contribute to unnecessary carbon emissions, leading to both environmental waste and increased operational expenses.

## Solution

This solution creates an intelligent workload optimization system that leverages Azure Carbon Optimization for granular emissions tracking and Azure Advisor for AI-driven recommendations. By combining these services with Azure Monitor for comprehensive observability and Azure Automation for automated remediation, organizations can achieve continuous optimization that reduces both carbon emissions and costs while maintaining performance standards.

3. PowerShell 7.0 or later for runbook development
4. Understanding of Azure resource management and monitoring concepts
5. Knowledge of sustainability metrics and carbon footprint analysis
6. Estimated cost: $15-25 per month for automation resources and monitoring

> **Note**: Azure Carbon Optimization is available at no additional cost in the Azure portal. Ensure you have at least Contributor role on the subscription to access carbon optimization data and create automation resources.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables for Azure resources
export RESOURCE_GROUP="rg-carbon-optimization-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export LOCATION="eastus"
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id --output tsv)
export AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT="aa-carbon-opt-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export WORKSPACE_NAME="law-carbon-opt-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export WORKBOOK_NAME="carbon-optimization-dashboard"

# Generate unique suffix for resource names
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(openssl rand -hex 3)

# Create resource group with sustainability tags
az group create \
    --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --tags purpose=sustainability environment=production \
           project=carbon-optimization

# Create Log Analytics workspace for monitoring
az monitor log-analytics workspace create \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --workspace-name ${WORKSPACE_NAME} \
    --location ${LOCATION} \
    --sku pergb2018

# Store workspace ID for later use
export WORKSPACE_ID=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show \
    --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
    --workspace-name ${WORKSPACE_NAME} \
    --query customerId --output tsv)

echo "✅ Foundation resources created successfully"
echo "   Resource Group: ${RESOURCE_GROUP}"
echo "   Log Analytics Workspace: ${WORKSPACE_NAME}"
```

## Steps

1. **Configure Azure Carbon Optimization Access**:

   Azure Carbon Optimization provides granular emissions tracking at the resource level, enabling organizations to understand their environmental impact down to individual Azure services. This foundational step ensures proper role-based access control and establishes the baseline for carbon emissions monitoring across your Azure footprint.

   ```bash
   # Enable Carbon Optimization Reader role for monitoring
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id --output tsv) \
       --role "Carbon Optimization Reader" \
       --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
   
   # Verify carbon optimization access
   az rest --method GET \
       --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/providers/Microsoft.Sustainability/carbonEmissions?api-version=2023-11-01-preview" \
       --query "value[0].properties.carbonEmissions" \
       --output table
   
   echo "✅ Carbon Optimization access configured"
   ```

   The Carbon Optimization Reader role provides the necessary permissions to access emissions data while maintaining security through least-privilege access. This role enables automated systems to retrieve carbon metrics without broader administrative permissions.

2. **Create Azure Automation Account with Managed Identity**:

   Azure Automation provides the orchestration platform for intelligent workload optimization, enabling automated responses to carbon optimization recommendations. The managed identity ensures secure authentication to Azure services without storing credentials, following Azure security best practices.

   ```bash
   # Create Azure Automation account with system-assigned managed identity
   az automation account create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name ${AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT} \
       --location ${LOCATION} \
       --assign-identity \
       --tags purpose=sustainability automation-type=carbon-optimization
   
   # Get the managed identity principal ID
   export IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID=$(az automation account show \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --name ${AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT} \
       --query identity.principalId --output tsv)
   
   # Grant managed identity permissions for resource management
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee ${IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID} \
       --role "Contributor" \
       --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
   
   # Grant Carbon Optimization Reader role to managed identity
   az role assignment create \
       --assignee ${IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID} \
       --role "Carbon Optimization Reader" \
       --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}"
   
   echo "✅ Automation account created with managed identity"
   ```

   The Automation account now has the necessary permissions to read carbon optimization data and perform resource optimization actions. This automated approach ensures consistent enforcement of sustainability policies without manual intervention.

3. **Deploy Carbon Optimization Monitoring Runbook**:

   This PowerShell runbook integrates with Azure Carbon Optimization APIs to collect emissions data and generate optimization recommendations. The runbook processes carbon metrics alongside Azure Advisor recommendations to create comprehensive sustainability insights.

   # Get carbon emissions data
   $carbonEndpoint = "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$SubscriptionId/providers/Microsoft.Sustainability/carbonEmissions?api-version=2023-11-01-preview"
   $carbonData = Invoke-AzRestMethod -Uri $carbonEndpoint -Method GET
   
   # Get Azure Advisor recommendations
   $advisorRecommendations = Get-AzAdvisorRecommendation | Where-Object { $_.Category -eq "Cost" -or $_.Category -eq "Performance" }
   
   # Process carbon optimization opportunities
   foreach ($recommendation in $advisorRecommendations) {
       $carbonImpact = @{
           RecommendationId = $recommendation.RecommendationId
           ResourceId = $recommendation.ResourceId
           ImpactedValue = $recommendation.ImpactedValue
           Category = $recommendation.Category
           CarbonSavingsEstimate = [math]::Round(($recommendation.ImpactedValue * 0.4), 2)
           OptimizationAction = $recommendation.ShortDescription
           Timestamp = (Get-Date).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ")
       }
       
       # Send to Log Analytics
       $json = $carbonImpact | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10
       Send-AzOperationalInsightsDataCollector -WorkspaceId $WorkspaceId -WorkspaceKey $WorkspaceKey -CustomLogName "CarbonOptimization" -JsonMessage $json
   }
   
   Write-Output "Carbon optimization analysis completed. Processed $($advisorRecommendations.Count) recommendations."
   EOF
   
   # Import the runbook
   az automation runbook create \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --automation-account-name ${AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT} \
       --name "CarbonOptimizationMonitoring" \
       --type PowerShell \
       --description "Monitor carbon emissions and generate optimization recommendations"
   
   # Import runbook content
   az automation runbook replace-content \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --automation-account-name ${AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT} \
       --name "CarbonOptimizationMonitoring" \
       --content @carbon-monitoring-runbook.ps1
   
   # Publish the runbook
   az automation runbook publish \
       --resource-group ${RESOURCE_GROUP} \
       --automation-account-name ${AUTOMATION_ACCOUNT} \
       --name "CarbonOptimizationMonitoring"
