# Adaptive Marketing Campaign Intelligence with Vertex AI Agents and Google Workspace Flows

## Problem

Marketing teams struggle with fragmented campaign data scattered across multiple platforms, making it impossible to respond quickly to changing customer behaviors and market conditions. Traditional marketing automation tools lack the intelligence to analyze complex patterns, adapt strategies in real-time, and orchestrate personalized outreach across various touchpoints. Without an integrated system that can process campaign performance data, extract actionable insights, and automatically trigger appropriate responses, businesses miss critical opportunities to optimize customer engagement and maximize campaign ROI.

## Solution

Build an intelligent marketing automation ecosystem using Vertex AI Agents to analyze campaign performance data stored in BigQuery, automatically detect patterns and anomalies, and trigger adaptive responses through Google Workspace Flows. The AI agents continuously monitor customer engagement metrics, sentiment analysis, and conversion patterns to generate personalized recommendations and execute automated workflows across Gmail, Google Sheets, and other Workspace applications. This solution creates a closed-loop system where marketing intelligence directly drives personalized customer outreach and campaign optimization.

```

## Steps

1. **Create Campaign Performance Data Schema in BigQuery**:

   BigQuery serves as the central data warehouse for all marketing intelligence, providing the scalable analytics foundation needed to process large volumes of campaign data from multiple sources. The schema design supports both real-time streaming inserts and batch data loads while maintaining query performance for AI agent analysis.

   ```bash
   # Create campaign performance table
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.campaign_performance \
       campaign_id:STRING,campaign_name:STRING,channel:STRING,start_date:DATE,end_date:DATE,impressions:INTEGER,clicks:INTEGER,conversions:INTEGER,spend:FLOAT,revenue:FLOAT,ctr:FLOAT,conversion_rate:FLOAT,roas:FLOAT,audience_segment:STRING,geo_location:STRING,device_type:STRING,timestamp:TIMESTAMP
   
   # Create customer interaction events table
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.customer_interactions \
       customer_id:STRING,interaction_type:STRING,interaction_timestamp:TIMESTAMP,campaign_id:STRING,channel:STRING,engagement_score:FLOAT,sentiment_score:FLOAT,conversion_value:FLOAT,customer_lifetime_value:FLOAT,demographic_segment:STRING,behavioral_tags:STRING
   
   # Create AI insights and recommendations table
   bq mk --table \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}.ai_insights \
       insight_id:STRING,generated_timestamp:TIMESTAMP,insight_type:STRING,campaign_id:STRING,recommendation:STRING,confidence_score:FLOAT,predicted_impact:FLOAT,action_required:BOOLEAN,priority_level:STRING,execution_status:STRING
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery schema created for marketing intelligence"
   ```

   The comprehensive schema enables the AI agents to analyze campaign performance patterns, customer behavior trends, and generate actionable insights that drive automated workflow decisions across the Google Workspace ecosystem.

2. **Configure Vertex AI Agent for Campaign Analysis**:

   Vertex AI Agents provide the intelligent reasoning capabilities needed to analyze complex marketing data patterns and generate adaptive responses. The agent configuration defines the specific marketing intelligence tasks, data sources, and decision-making frameworks that guide automated campaign optimization.

   ```bash
   # Create agent configuration file
   cat > agent-config.json << EOF
   {
     "display_name": "${AGENT_NAME}",
     "description": "Intelligent marketing campaign analysis and optimization agent",
     "goal": "Analyze campaign performance data, identify optimization opportunities, and trigger adaptive marketing workflows",
     "instructions": [
       "Monitor campaign performance metrics in BigQuery for anomalies and trends",
       "Analyze customer interaction patterns to identify engagement opportunities", 
       "Generate personalized recommendations based on audience segments and behaviors",
       "Trigger automated workflows through Google Workspace Flows when action is required",
       "Continuously learn from campaign outcomes to improve future recommendations"
     ],
     "tools": [
       {
         "type": "bigquery",
         "config": {
           "project_id": "${PROJECT_ID}",
           "dataset_id": "${DATASET_NAME}"
         }
       },
       {
         "type": "workspace_integration",
         "config": {
           "gmail_api": true,
           "sheets_api": true,
           "docs_api": true
         }
       }
     ],
     "model": "gemini-1.5-pro",
     "knowledge_base": {
       "marketing_best_practices": true,
       "campaign_optimization_strategies": true,

   # Test workflow execution with sample data
   gcloud workspace flows trigger campaign-performance-alerts \
       --input='{"campaign_id": "test_001", "performance_anomaly": "high_spend_low_conversion"}'
   ```

   Expected output: All workflows listed as active with successful test execution generating appropriate automated responses

4. Test end-to-end marketing intelligence pipeline:

   ```bash
   # Insert sample campaign data
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
   "INSERT INTO \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.campaign_performance\`
   VALUES 
   ('camp_001', 'Summer Sale 2025', 'email', '2025-07-01', '2025-07-15', 50000, 2500, 125, 1500.00, 6250.00, 5.0, 5.0, 4.17, 'millennials', 'US-West', 'mobile', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()),
   ('camp_002', 'Product Launch Campaign', 'social', '2025-07-05', '2025-07-20', 75000, 3750, 188, 2250.00, 9400.00, 5.0, 5.0, 4.18, 'gen_z', 'US-East', 'desktop', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())"
   
   # Verify AI agent processes the data and generates insights
   sleep 30
   bq query --use_legacy_sql=false \
   "SELECT * FROM \`${PROJECT_ID}.${DATASET_NAME}.ai_insights\` ORDER BY generated_timestamp DESC LIMIT 5"
   ```

   Expected output: Sample data inserted successfully with AI-generated insights appearing in the insights table, demonstrating full pipeline functionality
