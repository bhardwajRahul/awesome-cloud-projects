   # Create primary data bucket for raw and processed data
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Create staging bucket for pipeline artifacts
   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}-staging
   
   # Enable versioning for data protection
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}-staging
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Storage buckets created successfully"
   ```

   The storage infrastructure now provides reliable, scalable data hosting with versioning enabled for data lineage and recovery. This foundation supports both the interactive development workflow in Colab Enterprise and the production data processing requirements of Cloud Data Fusion.

2. **Create BigQuery Dataset for Analytics**:

   ```bash
   # Create BigQuery dataset for analytics
   bq mk \
       --project_id=${PROJECT_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --dataset \
       ${DATASET_NAME}
   
   # Set dataset description
   bq update \
       --description "Analytics dataset for pipeline prototyping" \
       ${PROJECT_ID}:${DATASET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ BigQuery dataset created: ${DATASET_NAME}"
   ```

   The BigQuery dataset provides a serverless, highly scalable analytics platform that automatically optimizes query performance. This integration enables real-time validation of transformation results and supports advanced analytics workflows directly from Colab Enterprise notebooks.

   gcloud data-fusion instances create ${INSTANCE_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --edition=developer \
       --enable-stackdriver-logging \
       --enable-stackdriver-monitoring
   
   # Wait for instance to become ready (this may take 15-20 minutes)
   echo "⏳ Waiting for Data Fusion instance to become ready..."
   gcloud data-fusion instances wait ${INSTANCE_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --condition=ready
   
   echo "✅ Cloud Data Fusion instance deployed successfully"
   ```

   The Cloud Data Fusion instance now provides a fully managed, visual pipeline development environment with built-in data quality validation, monitoring, and scaling capabilities. This platform enables seamless transition from notebook prototypes to production-ready data pipelines.

4. **Create Sample Data for Pipeline Development**:

   FUSION_ENDPOINT=$(gcloud data-fusion instances describe ${INSTANCE_NAME} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --format="value(apiEndpoint)")
   
   # Create runtime template for Colab Enterprise
   cat > runtime_config.yaml << EOF
   acceleratorConfig:
     coreCount: '0'
     type: NVIDIA_TESLA_T4
   dataDiskSizeGb: '100'
   dataDiskType: PD_STANDARD
   machineType: n1-standard-4
   metadata:
     framework: TensorFlow
     install-nvidia-driver: 'True'
   networks:
   - subnet: default
   serviceAccount: ${PROJECT_ID}@appspot.gserviceaccount.com
   tags:
   - colab-enterprise
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Colab Enterprise configuration ready"
   echo "📝 Data Fusion endpoint: ${FUSION_ENDPOINT}"
   echo "📝 Access Colab Enterprise via Google Cloud Console > Vertex AI > Colab Enterprise"
   ```

   The Colab Enterprise environment is now configured with appropriate compute resources and service account permissions for seamless integration with Cloud Data Fusion, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage.

This approach allows data scientists to validate transformation rules, test data quality checks, and optimize performance before productionizing pipelines.

   ```bash
   # Create sample notebook content for pipeline prototyping
   cat > pipeline_prototype.ipynb << 'EOF'
   {
     "cells": [
       {
         "cell_type": "markdown",
         "metadata": {},
         "source": [
           "# Pipeline Prototype: Customer Transaction Analysis\n",
           "This notebook demonstrates interactive pipeline development for Cloud Data Fusion"
         ]
       },
       {
         "cell_type": "code",
         "execution_count": null,
         "metadata": {},
         "source": [
           "import pandas as pd\n",
           "import json\n",
           "from google.cloud import bigquery, storage\n",
           "from datetime import datetime\n",
           "\n",
           "# Initialize clients\n",
           "bq_client = bigquery.Client()\n",
           "storage_client = storage.Client()\n",
           "\n",
           "PROJECT_ID = '", "${PROJECT_ID}", "'\n",
           "BUCKET_NAME = '", "${BUCKET_NAME}", "'\n",
           "DATASET_NAME = '", "${DATASET_NAME}", "'"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   EOF
   
   # Upload notebook template to Cloud Storage
   gsutil cp pipeline_prototype.ipynb gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/notebooks/

               "requiredInputs": "CustomerSource,TransactionSource"
             }
           }
         },
         {
           "name": "BigQuerySink",
           "plugin": {
             "name": "BigQueryTable",
             "type": "batchsink",
             "properties": {
               "project": "${PROJECT_ID}",
               "dataset": "${DATASET_NAME}",
               "table": "customer_transactions"
             }
           }
         }
       ],

## Discussion

This solution demonstrates the power of combining interactive notebook development with enterprise-grade pipeline orchestration for data pipeline prototyping and deployment. Colab Enterprise provides data scientists with a familiar, collaborative environment for exploring data transformations, while Cloud Data Fusion offers the scalability and reliability required for production data processing. The integration between these services enables a seamless workflow from experimentation to production deployment.

The architectural pattern follows Google Cloud's recommended approach for modern data platform development, emphasizing the separation of concerns between data exploration, transformation logic development, and production pipeline orchestration. By leveraging BigQuery as the analytics engine and Cloud Storage as the data lake foundation, organizations can build comprehensive data platforms that support both ad-hoc analysis and scheduled data processing workflows. This approach reduces the traditional friction between data science teams and data engineering teams by providing shared tools and consistent deployment patterns.

The interactive development workflow significantly accelerates pipeline development cycles by enabling immediate feedback on transformation logic, data quality validation, and performance characteristics. Data scientists can iterate rapidly on complex transformations using familiar Python libraries and pandas operations, then translate successful patterns into production pipeline configurations. This approach reduces development time and improves the reliability of production deployments by thoroughly validating transformation logic before scaling to large datasets.

> **Tip**: Use Colab Enterprise's integration with Vertex AI for advanced ML model development alongside your data pipeline prototyping. This enables end-to-end ML workflows from data preparation through model deployment, all within the same collaborative environment.

The monitoring and observability capabilities provided by Cloud Data Fusion, combined with Google Cloud's operations suite, enable comprehensive visibility into pipeline performance, data quality, and system health. Organizations can implement sophisticated alerting and automated remediation patterns to ensure reliable data delivery for downstream analytics and machine learning applications.
