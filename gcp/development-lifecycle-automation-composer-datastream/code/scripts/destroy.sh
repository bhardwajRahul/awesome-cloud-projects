Development Lifecycle Automation Cleanup Report
=============================================

Cleanup Date: $(date)
Project ID: $PROJECT_ID
Region: $REGION
Script Mode: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "DRY-RUN"; else echo "EXECUTION"; fi)

Operations Performed:
- Cloud Composer Environment: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would delete"; else echo "Deletion initiated"; fi)
- Datastream Resources: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would delete"; else echo "Deleted"; fi)
- Cloud SQL Instances: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would delete"; else echo "Deleted"; fi)
- Artifact Registry: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would delete"; else echo "Deleted"; fi)
- Cloud Workflows: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would delete"; else echo "Deleted"; fi)
- Security Policies: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would reset"; else echo "Reset"; fi)
- Storage Buckets: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would delete"; else echo "Deleted"; fi)
- Local Files: $(if [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would clean"; else echo "Cleaned"; fi)
- Project: $(if [[ "$KEEP_PROJECT" == true ]]; then echo "Preserved"; elif [[ "$DRY_RUN" == true ]]; then echo "Would delete"; else echo "Deletion initiated"; fi)

Log File: $LOG_FILE

Notes:
- Cloud Composer environment deletion may take 10-15 minutes to complete
- Project deletion (if initiated) may take several minutes
- Check GCP Console for final operation status
- Some operations may have failed - check the log file for details

Post-Cleanup Actions:
- Verify all resources are deleted in GCP Console
- Check billing to confirm charges have stopped
- Remove any remaining local files manually if needed
