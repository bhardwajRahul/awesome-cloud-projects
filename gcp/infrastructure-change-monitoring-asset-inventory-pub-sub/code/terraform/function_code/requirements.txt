# ==============================================================================
# Cloud Function Dependencies for Infrastructure Change Monitoring
# ==============================================================================
# This file specifies the Python package dependencies required for the
# Cloud Function that processes infrastructure change events from Cloud
# Asset Inventory and stores audit data in BigQuery.

# Google Cloud Client Libraries
# -----------------------------
# Core BigQuery client for storing audit records
google-cloud-bigquery==3.13.0

# Cloud Monitoring client for custom metrics and alerting
google-cloud-monitoring==2.16.0

# Cloud Logging client for structured logging (included in Cloud Functions runtime)
# google-cloud-logging==3.8.0  # Already available in runtime

# Cloud Storage client for potential file operations (optional)
# google-cloud-storage==2.10.0  # Uncomment if file operations needed

# Core Google Cloud library (automatically included with above packages)
# google-cloud-core==2.3.3

# Authentication and Core Dependencies
# ------------------------------------
# Google authentication library (included in Cloud Functions runtime)
# google-auth==2.23.4

# Google API core library (included with client libraries)
# google-api-core==2.12.0

# Data Processing and Utilities
# -----------------------------
# JSON processing (part of Python standard library)
# json

# Base64 encoding/decoding (part of Python standard library)
# base64

# Datetime handling (part of Python standard library)
# datetime

# Logging utilities (part of Python standard library)
# logging

# Operating system interface (part of Python standard library)
# os

# Type hints support (part of Python standard library for Python 3.9+)
# typing

# Optional Dependencies for Enhanced Functionality
# ------------------------------------------------
# Uncomment the following packages if additional functionality is needed:

# For more advanced JSON processing and validation
# jsonschema==4.19.1

# For enhanced datetime parsing and timezone handling
# python-dateutil==2.8.2

# For retry logic and exponential backoff
# google-cloud-core[grpc]==2.3.3

# For enhanced error handling and HTTP requests
# requests==2.31.0

# For data validation and parsing
# pydantic==2.4.2

# Performance and Monitoring Dependencies
# ---------------------------------------
# For memory profiling and performance monitoring (development only)
# memory-profiler==0.61.0

# For structured logging in JSON format
# structlog==23.1.0

# For application performance monitoring integration
# opencensus-ext-stackdriver==0.8.0

# Development and Testing Dependencies
# ------------------------------------
# The following dependencies are useful for local development and testing
# but are not required in the Cloud Functions runtime:

# For unit testing (available in Cloud Functions runtime)
# pytest==7.4.2

# For mocking Google Cloud services in tests
# google-cloud-testutils==1.3.3

# For code formatting and linting
# black==23.9.1
# flake8==6.1.0

# Security and Compliance
# -----------------------
# All dependencies are pinned to specific versions for security and
# reproducibility. Regular updates should be performed to address
# security vulnerabilities.

# Version Compatibility Notes
# ---------------------------
# - google-cloud-bigquery 3.13.0: Compatible with Python 3.9+ runtime
# - google-cloud-monitoring 2.16.0: Compatible with Python 3.9+ runtime
# - All packages tested with Cloud Functions Python 3.9 runtime
# - Dependencies automatically include required transitive dependencies

# Runtime Environment
# -------------------
# This requirements.txt is designed for Google Cloud Functions Python 3.9 runtime
# The Cloud Functions environment provides many common packages by default
# Only additional packages needed for specific functionality are included

# Installation Notes
# ------------------
# Cloud Functions automatically installs these dependencies during deployment
# Local development: pip install -r requirements.txt
# Testing: Ensure all packages are compatible with Python 3.9+

# Memory and Performance Considerations
# ------------------------------------
# The selected packages are optimized for:
# - Low memory footprint suitable for 256MB function instances
# - Fast cold start times
# - Minimal dependency conflicts
# - Efficient BigQuery and Monitoring API operations

# Security Considerations
# ----------------------
# - All packages are from trusted sources (Google Cloud, PyPI official)
# - Version pinning prevents supply chain attacks
# - No unnecessary packages that could introduce vulnerabilities
# - Regular security scanning recommended for production deployments
