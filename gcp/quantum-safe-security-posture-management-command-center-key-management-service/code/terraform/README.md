# Check asset inventory feed
gcloud asset feeds describe quantum-crypto-assets --organization=YOUR_ORG_ID

# View monitoring dashboard
# Access: https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Post-Quantum Algorithms

Configure quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms:

```hcl
pq_algorithms = {
  ml_dsa  = "PQ_SIGN_ML_DSA_65"         # Lattice-based (default)
  slh_dsa = "PQ_SIGN_SLH_DSA_SHA2_128S" # Hash-based (default)
}

# Alternative configurations:
# ml_dsa  = "PQ_SIGN_ML_DSA_87"         # Higher security level
# slh_dsa = "PQ_SIGN_SLH_DSA_SHA2_192S" # Higher security level
```

### Key Rotation Settings

Configure automatic key rotation for cryptographic agility:

```hcl
# Rotation periods (in seconds)
kms_key_rotation_period = "2592000s"  # 30 days (default)
# kms_key_rotation_period = "604800s"   # 7 days (high security)
# kms_key_rotation_period = "7776000s"  # 90 days (standard)
```

### Compliance Scheduling

Configure automated compliance report generation:

```hcl
compliance_schedule = "0 9 1 */3 *"  # Quarterly at 9 AM UTC (default)
# compliance_schedule = "0 9 * * 1"    # Weekly on Mondays
# compliance_schedule = "0 9 1 * *"    # Monthly on 1st day
```

### Asset Tracking Scope

Customize which asset types to monitor for quantum vulnerabilities:

```hcl
asset_types_to_track = [
  "cloudkms.googleapis.com/CryptoKey",
  "cloudkms.googleapis.com/KeyRing",
  "compute.googleapis.com/Disk",
  "compute.googleapis.com/Instance",
  "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket",
  "sql.googleapis.com/DatabaseInstance"
]
```

## üìä Monitoring and Compliance

### Quantum Security Dashboard

The deployment creates a comprehensive monitoring dashboard accessible at:
```
https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/custom/DASHBOARD_ID?project=PROJECT_ID
```

**Dashboard Metrics:**
- Post-quantum key usage and adoption rates
- Quantum vulnerability alerts and trends
- Cryptographic asset inventory changes
- Key rotation compliance status

### Automated Compliance Reports

Compliance reports are automatically generated and include:

- **Quantum Readiness Score**: 0-100 scale based on post-quantum adoption
- **Asset Analysis**: Breakdown of quantum-safe vs. vulnerable cryptographic keys
- **Security Findings**: Integration with Security Command Center alerts
- **Recommendations**: Prioritized action items for quantum security improvement

Reports are stored in Cloud Storage and accessible via the Cloud Function endpoint.

### Alert Policies

The infrastructure includes alert policies for:

- **Quantum Vulnerabilities**: Immediate alerts when vulnerable algorithms are detected
- **Key Rotation Compliance**: Notifications when key rotation is overdue
- **Asset Changes**: Real-time notifications of cryptographic asset modifications
- **Compliance Violations**: Alerts for organization policy violations

## üîí Security Features

### Organization Policies

The deployment enforces quantum-safe security policies:

```hcl
# OS Login requirement for enhanced access control
enforce_os_login = true

# Disable service account key creation to improve security posture
disable_service_account_keys = true

# Restrict cryptographic algorithms to quantum-safe only
# Automatically enforced through organization policy
```

### IAM and Access Control

- **Least Privilege Access**: Service accounts with minimal required permissions
- **Automated Role Management**: IAM bindings for secure inter-service communication
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-related operations

### Data Protection

3. **Annually**: Review and update organization policies and security controls

### Monitoring Best Practices

- Monitor key rotation compliance and address any missed rotations
- Review security findings and prioritize high-severity quantum vulnerabilities
- Track post-quantum adoption rates across the organization
- Maintain up-to-date documentation of cryptographic asset inventory

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

- **State File Backups**: Use remote state backends with versioning
- **Configuration Backups**: Maintain infrastructure as code in version control
- **Key Recovery**: Follow Google Cloud KMS key recovery procedures
- **Documentation**: Keep deployment and configuration documentation current

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `Error creating KMS key: Post-quantum algorithms not available`
**Solution**: Ensure your selected region supports post-quantum cryptography features

**Issue**: `Organization policy constraint not found`
**Solution**: Verify Security Command Center Enterprise subscription is active

**Issue**: `Insufficient permissions for Cloud Asset Inventory`
**Solution**: Ensure service account has `roles/cloudasset.viewer` at organization level

**Issue**: `Cloud Function deployment timeout`
**Solution**: Check function source code and dependencies, consider increasing memory allocation

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for troubleshooting:

```hcl
enable_debug_logging = true
```
