# Infrastructure as Code Generation Complete

This marker file indicates that the Terraform infrastructure code generation for the 
"User Lifecycle Management with Firebase Authentication and Cloud Tasks" recipe has been completed.

## Generated Files

### Terraform Configuration
- `terraform/versions.tf` - Provider requirements and configuration
- `terraform/variables.tf` - Input variables with validation
- `terraform/main.tf` - Core infrastructure resources
- `terraform/outputs.tf` - Output values for integration

### Worker Application Source
- `terraform/worker-app/package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `terraform/worker-app/index.js` - Main application logic
- `terraform/worker-app/Dockerfile` - Container build configuration

## Infrastructure Components

The generated Terraform code deploys a complete serverless user lifecycle management system:

1. **Firebase Authentication** - User identity and authentication
2. **Cloud SQL PostgreSQL** - User analytics and engagement data storage
3. **Cloud Tasks** - Reliable background task processing queue
4. **Cloud Run** - Serverless worker service for processing lifecycle events
5. **Cloud Scheduler** - Automated job scheduling for periodic tasks
6. **Secret Manager** - Secure credential storage
7. **Cloud Logging** - Centralized logging and monitoring
8. **Service Accounts** - Secure access control with least privilege

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set required variables in `terraform.tfvars`
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration
3. Run `terraform plan` to review the deployment plan
4. Run `terraform apply` to deploy the infrastructure
5. Deploy the worker container using Cloud Build or local Docker
6. Configure Firebase Authentication providers in the Firebase Console

## Security Features

- IAM service accounts with least privilege permissions
- Database password stored securely in Secret Manager
- Cloud Run service restricted to internal traffic only
- SSL/TLS encryption for database connections
- Audit logging enabled for compliance
- Non-root container user for enhanced security

## Cost Optimization

- Cloud SQL db-f1-micro tier for development/testing
- Cloud Run auto-scaling from 0 to minimize idle costs
- Storage lifecycle policies for automated cleanup
- Regional deployment to reduce data transfer costs
