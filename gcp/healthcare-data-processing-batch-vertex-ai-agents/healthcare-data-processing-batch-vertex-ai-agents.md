   gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} \
       -c STANDARD \
       -l ${REGION} \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Enable versioning for data protection
   gsutil versioning set on gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Set bucket-level IAM for healthcare compliance
   gsutil iam ch \
       serviceAccount:batch-service@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com:objectViewer \
       gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   echo "✅ HIPAA-compliant storage bucket created: ${BUCKET_NAME}"
   ```

   The storage bucket is now configured with versioning and proper IAM controls, providing a secure foundation for healthcare data ingestion. This setup ensures data lineage tracking and supports regulatory audit requirements while enabling scalable access for downstream processing services.

   gcloud healthcare datasets create ${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --description="Healthcare AI processing dataset"
   
   # Create FHIR store for patient records
   gcloud healthcare fhir-stores create ${FHIR_STORE_ID} \
       --dataset=${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --version=R4 \
       --enable-update-create
   
   # Configure FHIR store security settings
   gcloud healthcare fhir-stores set-iam-policy ${FHIR_STORE_ID} \
       --dataset=${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       policy.json
   
   echo "✅ Healthcare API dataset and FHIR store created"
   ```

   The FHIR store now provides a standards-compliant repository for processed healthcare data. This infrastructure enables seamless integration with electronic health record systems and supports advanced querying capabilities for clinical decision support and population health analytics.

   # Create service account for Vertex AI agent
   gcloud iam service-accounts create healthcare-ai-agent \
       --display-name="Healthcare AI Analysis Agent" \
       --description="Service account for AI-powered healthcare data analysis"
   
   # Grant necessary permissions to the agent
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:healthcare-ai-agent@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
   
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} \
       --member="serviceAccount:healthcare-ai-agent@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
       --role="roles/healthcare.fhirResourceEditor"
   
   # Create the Vertex AI agent configuration
   cat > agent-config.yaml << EOF
   displayName: "Healthcare Records Analyzer"
   description: "AI agent for intelligent healthcare data processing and compliance monitoring"
   tools:
     - healthcare_nlp_tool
     - compliance_checker_tool
     - clinical_insights_extractor
   instructions: |
     You are a healthcare AI agent specialized in medical record analysis.
     Process medical documents while maintaining HIPAA compliance.
     Extract clinical insights, identify critical findings, and ensure data accuracy.
   EOF
   
   echo "✅ Vertex AI healthcare agent configured"
   ```

   The Vertex AI agent is now equipped with healthcare-specific capabilities and appropriate permissions to process medical data securely. This intelligent component brings advanced natural language understanding to the pipeline, enabling automated extraction of clinical insights and compliance monitoring that scales with data volume.

4. **Configure Cloud Batch Job Template**:

   Cloud Batch orchestrates scalable compute workloads with automatic resource provisioning and job scheduling. Creating a template for healthcare data processing ensures consistent execution environments while enabling cost-effective scaling based on data volume and processing complexity.

   ```bash
   # Create batch job template for healthcare processing
   cat > healthcare-batch-job.yaml << EOF
   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: healthcare-processing-template
   spec:
     taskGroups:
     - name: healthcare-analysis
       taskSpec:
         runnables:
         - script:
             text: |
               #!/bin/bash
               echo "Starting healthcare data processing..."
               
               # Process medical records with AI analysis
               python3 /healthcare_processor.py \
                 --input-bucket=${BUCKET_NAME} \
                 --fhir-store=${FHIR_STORE_ID} \
                 --project=${PROJECT_ID} \
                 --region=${REGION}
               
               echo "Healthcare processing completed"
         computeResource:
           cpuMilli: 2000
           memoryMib: 4096
         maxRetryCount: 3
         maxRunDuration: 3600s
       taskCount: 1
       parallelism: 1
     allocationPolicy:
       instances:
       - policy:
           provisioningModel: STANDARD
           machineType: e2-standard-2
     logsPolicy:
       destination: CLOUD_LOGGING

       job_id = f"healthcare-processing-{file_name.replace('/', '-')}"
       
       response = batch_client.create_job(
           parent=parent,
           job_id=job_id,
           job=job
       )
       
       print(f"Healthcare processing job created: {response.name}")
       return {"status": "job_created", "job_name": response.name}

   # Verify healthcare dataset
   gcloud healthcare datasets describe ${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION}
   
   # Check FHIR store configuration
   gcloud healthcare fhir-stores describe ${FHIR_STORE_ID} \
       --dataset=${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION}
   ```

   Expected output: Bucket details with versioning enabled, healthcare dataset status as ACTIVE, and FHIR store with R4 version configured.

2. Test healthcare data processing workflow:

   ```bash
   # Create sample healthcare data file
   cat > sample_medical_record.json << EOF
   {
     "patient_id": "PATIENT_12345",
     "encounter_date": "2025-07-12",
     "chief_complaint": "Routine checkup",
     "vital_signs": {
       "blood_pressure": "120/80",
       "heart_rate": 72,
       "temperature": 98.6
     },
     "assessment": "Patient appears healthy",
     "plan": "Continue current medications, follow up in 6 months"
   }
   EOF
   
   # Upload test file to trigger processing
   gsutil cp sample_medical_record.json gs://${BUCKET_NAME}/test/
   
   # Monitor batch job creation
   gcloud batch jobs list --location=${REGION}
   
   echo "✅ Test file uploaded and processing initiated"
   ```

3. Verify AI agent and compliance monitoring:

   ```bash
   # Check Cloud Function logs
   gcloud functions logs read healthcare-processor-trigger \
       --limit=10
   
   # Monitor batch job execution
   gcloud batch jobs describe healthcare-processing-test \
       --location=${REGION}
   
   # Check compliance monitoring dashboard
   gcloud monitoring dashboards list
   ```

   Expected output: Function logs showing successful trigger, batch job in RUNNING or SUCCEEDED state, and monitoring dashboard displaying processing metrics.

## Cleanup

1. Remove batch jobs and Cloud Functions:

   ```bash
   # Delete all batch jobs
   gcloud batch jobs list --location=${REGION} \
       --format="value(name)" | \
       xargs -I {} gcloud batch jobs delete {} --location=${REGION} --quiet
   
   # Delete Cloud Function
   gcloud functions delete healthcare-processor-trigger --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Batch jobs and Cloud Functions deleted"
   ```

2. Remove Vertex AI agent and Healthcare API resources:

   ```bash
   # Delete FHIR store
   gcloud healthcare fhir-stores delete ${FHIR_STORE_ID} \
       --dataset=${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --quiet
   
   # Delete healthcare dataset
   gcloud healthcare datasets delete ${DATASET_ID} \
       --location=${REGION} \
       --quiet
   
   # Delete service accounts
   gcloud iam service-accounts delete \
       healthcare-ai-agent@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
       --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Healthcare API and AI resources deleted"
   ```

3. Remove storage and monitoring resources:

   ```bash
   # Delete Cloud Storage bucket and contents
   gsutil -m rm -r gs://${BUCKET_NAME}
   
   # Delete monitoring dashboard
   gcloud monitoring dashboards list --format="value(name)" | \
       grep "Healthcare" | \
       xargs -I {} gcloud monitoring dashboards delete {} --quiet
   
   # Delete alert policies
   gcloud alpha monitoring policies list --format="value(name)" | \
       grep -i healthcare | \
       xargs -I {} gcloud alpha monitoring policies delete {} --quiet
   
   # Delete project (optional - only if created specifically for this recipe)
   gcloud projects delete ${PROJECT_ID} --quiet
   
   echo "✅ Storage and monitoring resources cleaned up"
   echo "Note: Project deletion may take several minutes to complete"
