# Unified Identity Management System

## Problem

Organizations with distributed workforces face significant challenges managing user identities across on-premises and cloud environments, leading to security gaps, administrative overhead, and poor user experience. Traditional identity management solutions require complex federation setups, multiple credential sets, and lack seamless integration with cloud services like virtual desktops and managed databases. Without centralized identity management, IT teams struggle to enforce consistent security policies, users experience authentication friction, and organizations face increased compliance risks.

## Solution

AWS Directory Service provides a fully managed Microsoft Active Directory solution that bridges on-premises and cloud identity management through trust relationships and seamless AWS service integration. This approach establishes AWS Managed Microsoft AD as the central identity provider for cloud workloads while maintaining trust relationships with existing on-premises Active Directory, enabling single sign-on for WorkSpaces virtual desktops and Windows Authentication for RDS SQL Server databases. The solution provides centralized user management, consistent security policies, and simplified authentication across hybrid environments.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS account with appropriate permissions for Directory Service, WorkSpaces, and RDS
2. AWS CLI installed and configured (version 2.0 or later)
3. On-premises Active Directory environment with domain administrator access
4. VPC with at least two subnets in different Availability Zones
5. Network connectivity between on-premises and AWS (VPN or Direct Connect)
6. Knowledge of Active Directory concepts and Windows networking
7. Estimated cost: $350-450/month for AWS Managed Microsoft AD, WorkSpaces, and RDS instance

> **Note**: AWS Managed Microsoft AD requires two domain controllers for high availability at $0.20 per hour each ($292/month total). Additional costs include WorkSpaces and RDS usage.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables
export AWS_REGION=$(aws configure get region)
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity \
    --query Account --output text)

# Generate unique identifiers for resources
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(aws secretsmanager get-random-password \
    --exclude-punctuation --exclude-uppercase \
    --password-length 6 --require-each-included-type \
    --output text --query RandomPassword)

# Set resource names
export DIRECTORY_NAME="corp-hybrid-ad-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export VPC_NAME="hybrid-identity-vpc-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export WORKSPACE_BUNDLE_ID="wsb-bh8rsxt14"  # Standard bundle ID
export RDS_INSTANCE_ID="hybrid-sql-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

# Create VPC for directory services
aws ec2 create-vpc \
    --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 \
    --tag-specifications \
    'ResourceType=vpc,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value='${VPC_NAME}'}]'

# Get VPC ID
export VPC_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=${VPC_NAME}" \
    --query 'Vpcs[0].VpcId' --output text)

# Create subnets in different AZs
aws ec2 create-subnet \
    --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
    --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24 \
    --availability-zone ${AWS_REGION}a \
    --tag-specifications \
    'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=directory-subnet-1}]'

aws ec2 create-subnet \
    --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
    --cidr-block 10.0.2.0/24 \
    --availability-zone ${AWS_REGION}b \
    --tag-specifications \
    'ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=directory-subnet-2}]'

# Get subnet IDs
export SUBNET_ID_1=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=directory-subnet-1" \
    --query 'Subnets[0].SubnetId' --output text)

export SUBNET_ID_2=$(aws ec2 describe-subnets \
    --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=directory-subnet-2" \
    --query 'Subnets[0].SubnetId' --output text)

echo "✅ AWS environment prepared with VPC: ${VPC_ID}"
echo "✅ Subnets created: ${SUBNET_ID_1}, ${SUBNET_ID_2}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create AWS Managed Microsoft AD Directory**:

   AWS Managed Microsoft AD provides a fully managed Active Directory service that operates as a standalone directory or can establish trust relationships with on-premises Active Directory. This service creates two domain controllers in different Availability Zones for high availability and includes automatic patching, monitoring, and backup capabilities. The managed directory supports standard Active Directory features including Group Policy, Kerberos authentication, and LDAP queries.

   ```bash
   # Create AWS Managed Microsoft AD
   aws ds create-microsoft-ad \
       --name ${DIRECTORY_NAME}.corp.local \
       --password "TempPassword123!" \
       --description "Hybrid Identity Management Directory" \
       --vpc-settings VpcId=${VPC_ID},SubnetIds=${SUBNET_ID_1},${SUBNET_ID_2} \
       --edition Standard \
       --tags Key=Purpose,Value=HybridIdentity
   
   # Get directory ID
   export DIRECTORY_ID=$(aws ds describe-directories \
       --query 'DirectoryDescriptions[?Name==`'${DIRECTORY_NAME}'.corp.local`].DirectoryId' \
       --output text)
   
   # Wait for directory to become active
   aws ds wait directory-active --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID}
   
   echo "✅ AWS Managed Microsoft AD created: ${DIRECTORY_ID}"
   ```

   The directory is now operational with domain controllers managing authentication and authorization services. This establishes the foundation for hybrid identity management with enterprise-grade security features and automatic maintenance.

2. **Configure Directory Security Groups and Network Access**:

   Directory Service automatically creates security groups to protect domain controllers while allowing necessary Active Directory communication. These security groups must be properly configured to enable secure communication between AWS services and on-premises resources while maintaining the principle of least privilege access.

   ```bash
   # Get directory security group ID
   export DIRECTORY_SG_ID=$(aws ds describe-directories \
       --directory-ids ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'DirectoryDescriptions[0].VpcSettings.SecurityGroupId' \
       --output text)
   
   # Create security group for WorkSpaces
   aws ec2 create-security-group \
       --group-name workspaces-sg-${RANDOM_SUFFIX} \
       --description "Security group for WorkSpaces" \
       --vpc-id ${VPC_ID} \
       --tag-specifications \
       'ResourceType=security-group,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=workspaces-sg}]'
   
   export WORKSPACES_SG_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups \
       --filters "Name=group-name,Values=workspaces-sg-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --query 'SecurityGroups[0].GroupId' --output text)
   
   # Allow WorkSpaces to communicate with directory
   aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
       --group-id ${DIRECTORY_SG_ID} \
       --protocol tcp \
       --port 445 \
       --source-group ${WORKSPACES_SG_ID}
   
   echo "✅ Directory security groups configured"
   echo "✅ WorkSpaces security group created: ${WORKSPACES_SG_ID}"
   ```

   Security groups now provide controlled access between directory services and AWS resources, enabling secure communication while preventing unauthorized access to domain controllers.

3. **Enable AWS Applications and Services for Directory**:

   AWS Directory Service integration enables other AWS services to authenticate users and authorize access using the managed directory. This step configures the directory to work with WorkSpaces and RDS, allowing these services to leverage Active Directory for user authentication and access control.

   ```bash
   # Enable AWS applications and services
   aws ds enable-client-authentication \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --type SmartCard
   
   # Enable LDAPS for secure communication
   aws ds enable-ldaps \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --type Client
   
   # Wait for LDAPS to be enabled
   sleep 30
   
   # Verify directory status
   aws ds describe-directories \
       --directory-ids ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'DirectoryDescriptions[0].Stage' \
       --output text
   
   echo "✅ Directory enabled for AWS service integration"
   ```

   The directory now supports secure LDAP connections and smart card authentication, providing enterprise-grade security features for integrated AWS services.

4. **Create IAM Role for Directory Service Integration**:

   RDS SQL Server requires an IAM role to integrate with Directory Service for Windows Authentication. This role provides the necessary permissions for RDS to authenticate users against the managed directory and manage domain membership.

   ```bash
   # Create IAM role for RDS Directory Service integration
   aws iam create-role \
       --role-name rds-directoryservice-role \
       --assume-role-policy-document '{
           "Version": "2012-10-17",
           "Statement": [
               {
                   "Effect": "Allow",
                   "Principal": {
                       "Service": "rds.amazonaws.com"
                   },
                   "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
               }
           ]
       }'
   
   # Attach AWS managed policy for Directory Service
   aws iam attach-role-policy \
       --role-name rds-directoryservice-role \
       --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonRDSDirectoryServiceAccess
   
   echo "✅ IAM role created for RDS Directory Service integration"
   ```

   The IAM role now enables RDS to integrate with Directory Service for Windows Authentication support.

5. **Create WorkSpaces Directory Registration**:

   WorkSpaces requires directory registration to enable virtual desktop provisioning with Active Directory authentication. This registration process configures WorkSpaces to use the managed directory for user authentication and enables domain-joined virtual desktops that provide seamless access to corporate resources.

   ```bash
   # Register directory with WorkSpaces
   aws workspaces register-workspace-directory \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --enable-work-docs \
       --subnet-ids ${SUBNET_ID_1} ${SUBNET_ID_2} \
       --enable-self-service
   
   # Wait for registration to complete
   sleep 60
   
   # Verify directory registration
   aws workspaces describe-workspace-directories \
       --directory-ids ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'Directories[0].State' \
       --output text
   
   echo "✅ WorkSpaces directory registered successfully"
   ```

   WorkSpaces can now provision virtual desktops using the managed directory for authentication, enabling users to access cloud-based workstations with their existing credentials.

6. **Create Test User in Managed Directory**:

   Creating test users in the managed directory enables validation of authentication and access controls. These users can be used to test WorkSpaces access and RDS Windows Authentication, ensuring the hybrid identity solution functions correctly before integrating with on-premises Active Directory.

   ```bash
   # Create test user (requires domain admin privileges)
   # This would typically be done through EC2 instance joined to domain
   # For demonstration, we'll show the PowerShell commands
   
   # Create EC2 instance for domain management
   aws ec2 run-instances \
       --image-id ami-0c02fb55956c7d316 \
       --instance-type t3.medium \
       --subnet-id ${SUBNET_ID_1} \
       --security-group-ids ${WORKSPACES_SG_ID} \
       --tag-specifications \
       'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=domain-admin-instance}]'
   
   export ADMIN_INSTANCE_ID=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
       --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=domain-admin-instance" \
       --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].InstanceId' \
       --output text)
   
   # Wait for instance to be running
   aws ec2 wait instance-running --instance-ids ${ADMIN_INSTANCE_ID}
   
   echo "✅ Domain admin instance created: ${ADMIN_INSTANCE_ID}"
   echo "✅ Use RDP to connect and create test users with PowerShell"
   ```

   The domain admin instance provides a platform for managing directory users and groups, enabling full Active Directory administration capabilities within the AWS environment.

7. **Configure RDS SQL Server with Windows Authentication**:

   RDS SQL Server integration with AWS Directory Service enables Windows Authentication for database connections, providing seamless access using Active Directory credentials. This configuration eliminates the need for separate database credentials and enables centralized user management for database access.

   ```bash
   # Create DB subnet group
   aws rds create-db-subnet-group \
       --db-subnet-group-name hybrid-db-subnet-group \
       --db-subnet-group-description "Subnet group for hybrid RDS" \
       --subnet-ids ${SUBNET_ID_1} ${SUBNET_ID_2} \
       --tags Key=Purpose,Value=HybridIdentity
   
   # Create RDS SQL Server instance with Directory Service integration
   aws rds create-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier ${RDS_INSTANCE_ID} \
       --db-instance-class db.t3.medium \
       --engine sqlserver-se \
       --master-username admin \
       --master-user-password "TempPassword123!" \
       --allocated-storage 200 \
       --storage-type gp2 \
       --vpc-security-group-ids ${WORKSPACES_SG_ID} \
       --db-subnet-group-name hybrid-db-subnet-group \
       --domain ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --domain-iam-role-name rds-directoryservice-role \
       --tags Key=Purpose,Value=HybridIdentity
   
   # Wait for RDS instance to be available
   aws rds wait db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier ${RDS_INSTANCE_ID}
   
   echo "✅ RDS SQL Server instance created with Directory Service integration"
   ```

   The RDS instance now supports Windows Authentication, enabling users to connect using their Active Directory credentials without separate database logins.

8. **Create WorkSpaces for Test Users**:

   WorkSpaces provisioning creates virtual desktops that are automatically joined to the managed directory domain. These virtual desktops provide users with secure, cloud-based workstations that maintain access to corporate resources and applications while enabling remote work capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create WorkSpaces for test users
   aws workspaces create-workspaces \
       --workspaces '[{
           "DirectoryId": "'${DIRECTORY_ID}'",
           "UserName": "testuser1",
           "BundleId": "'${WORKSPACE_BUNDLE_ID}'",
           "VolumeEncryptionKey": "alias/aws/workspaces",
           "UserVolumeEncryptionEnabled": true,
           "RootVolumeEncryptionEnabled": true,
           "WorkspaceProperties": {
               "RunningMode": "AUTO_STOP",
               "RunningModeAutoStopTimeoutInMinutes": 60,
               "ComputeTypeName": "STANDARD"
           },
           "Tags": [
               {
                   "Key": "Purpose",
                   "Value": "HybridIdentityTesting"
               }
           ]
       }]'
   
   # Monitor WorkSpaces creation
   aws workspaces describe-workspaces \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'Workspaces[0].State' \
       --output text
   
   echo "✅ WorkSpaces created for directory users"
   ```

   Users can now access secure virtual desktops using their directory credentials, providing a consistent work environment regardless of location.

9. **Configure Trust Relationship with On-Premises AD** (Optional):

   Trust relationships enable seamless authentication between AWS Managed Microsoft AD and on-premises Active Directory, allowing users to access AWS resources using their existing corporate credentials. This configuration supports both one-way and two-way trusts depending on organizational requirements.

   ```bash
   # Create trust relationship with on-premises AD
   # Note: This requires network connectivity (VPN/Direct Connect)
   
   # Example trust creation (replace with actual on-premises domain)
   aws ds create-trust \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --remote-domain-name "onprem.corp.local" \
       --trust-password "TrustPassword123!" \
       --trust-direction "Two-Way" \
       --trust-type "Forest" \
       --conditional-forwarder-ip-addrs "10.1.1.10" "10.1.1.11"
   
   # Monitor trust creation
   aws ds describe-trusts \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'Trusts[0].TrustState' \
       --output text
   
   echo "✅ Trust relationship configuration initiated"
   echo "Note: Complete trust setup requires on-premises domain admin actions"
   ```

   The trust relationship enables users from both domains to access resources in either environment, providing true hybrid identity management capabilities.

## Validation & Testing

1. **Verify Directory Service Status**:

   ```bash
   # Check directory status and configuration
   aws ds describe-directories \
       --directory-ids ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'DirectoryDescriptions[0].{Status:Stage,Name:Name,DnsIpAddrs:DnsIpAddrs}'
   
   # Verify LDAPS is enabled
   aws ds describe-ldaps-settings \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'LDAPSSettingsInfo[0].LDAPSStatus'
   ```

   Expected output: Directory should show "Active" status with DNS IP addresses available.

2. **Test WorkSpaces Directory Registration**:

   ```bash
   # Verify WorkSpaces directory registration
   aws workspaces describe-workspace-directories \
       --directory-ids ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'Directories[0].{State:State,Type:DirectoryType,Name:DirectoryName}'
   
   # List available WorkSpaces bundles
   aws workspaces describe-workspace-bundles \
       --query 'Bundles[?contains(Name,`Standard`)].{Name:Name,BundleId:BundleId}' \
       --output table
   ```

   Expected output: Directory should show "REGISTERED" state with available bundles listed.

3. **Validate RDS Directory Integration**:

   ```bash
   # Check RDS instance domain membership
   aws rds describe-db-instances \
       --db-instance-identifier ${RDS_INSTANCE_ID} \
       --query 'DBInstances[0].{Status:DBInstanceStatus,Domain:DomainMemberships[0].Domain,FQDN:DomainMemberships[0].FQDN}'
   
   # Test database connectivity (requires SQL Server client)
   aws rds describe-db-instances \
       --db-instance-identifier ${RDS_INSTANCE_ID} \
       --query 'DBInstances[0].Endpoint.Address' \
       --output text
   ```

   Expected output: RDS instance should show domain membership and endpoint address for testing.

4. **Test User Authentication**:

   ```bash
   # Verify WorkSpaces user access
   aws workspaces describe-workspaces \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'Workspaces[0].{State:State,UserName:UserName,IpAddress:IpAddress}'
   
   # Check directory user count
   aws ds describe-directories \
       --directory-ids ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --query 'DirectoryDescriptions[0].Size'
   ```

   Expected output: WorkSpaces should show "AVAILABLE" state with user assignment confirmed.

## Cleanup

1. **Remove WorkSpaces**:

   ```bash
   # Terminate WorkSpaces
   aws workspaces terminate-workspaces \
       --terminate-workspace-requests \
       "WorkspaceId=$(aws workspaces describe-workspaces \
           --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
           --query 'Workspaces[0].WorkspaceId' --output text)"
   
   # Wait for termination
   sleep 120
   
   # Deregister directory from WorkSpaces
   aws workspaces deregister-workspace-directory \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID}
   
   echo "✅ WorkSpaces terminated and directory deregistered"
   ```

2. **Remove RDS Instance**:

   ```bash
   # Delete RDS instance
   aws rds delete-db-instance \
       --db-instance-identifier ${RDS_INSTANCE_ID} \
       --skip-final-snapshot
   
   # Wait for deletion
   aws rds wait db-instance-deleted --db-instance-identifier ${RDS_INSTANCE_ID}
   
   # Delete DB subnet group
   aws rds delete-db-subnet-group \
       --db-subnet-group-name hybrid-db-subnet-group
   
   echo "✅ RDS instance and subnet group deleted"
   ```

3. **Remove Directory Service**:

   ```bash
   # Delete trust relationships (if created)
   aws ds delete-trust \
       --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
       --trust-id $(aws ds describe-trusts \
           --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID} \
           --query 'Trusts[0].TrustId' --output text) \
       --delete-associated-conditional-forwarder || true
   
   # Delete directory
   aws ds delete-directory --directory-id ${DIRECTORY_ID}
   
   echo "✅ Directory Service deleted"
   ```

4. **Remove IAM Role and EC2 Resources**:

   aws ec2 delete-subnet --subnet-id ${SUBNET_ID_2}
   
   # Delete VPC
   aws ec2 delete-vpc --vpc-id ${VPC_ID}
   
   echo "✅ All AWS resources cleaned up"
   ```

## Discussion

AWS Directory Service provides a comprehensive solution for hybrid identity management by bridging on-premises Active Directory with AWS cloud services. The AWS Managed Microsoft AD service operates as a fully managed Windows Server 2019-based directory with automatic patching, monitoring, and backup capabilities, eliminating the operational overhead of maintaining domain controllers while providing enterprise-grade Active Directory functionality.

The integration architecture enables seamless authentication across AWS services including WorkSpaces virtual desktops and RDS SQL Server databases. WorkSpaces users can access their cloud-based workstations using existing corporate credentials, while database applications can leverage Windows Authentication for secure database connections. This approach eliminates credential sprawl and provides consistent user experience across hybrid environments.

Trust relationships represent a critical component of hybrid identity management, enabling users from on-premises Active Directory to access AWS resources without requiring separate cloud accounts. Two-way trust relationships support scenarios where AWS resources need to authenticate against on-premises directories, while one-way trusts provide more restrictive access patterns. The conditional forwarder configuration ensures proper DNS resolution between domains, enabling seamless cross-domain authentication.

Security considerations include proper network segmentation through VPC design, security group configuration to control access to directory services, and encryption of data in transit through LDAPS. The solution follows AWS security best practices including least privilege access, network isolation, and comprehensive audit logging through CloudTrail integration. Organizations should implement multi-factor authentication and regular access reviews to maintain security posture.

> **Tip**: Enable CloudTrail logging for directory service activities to maintain comprehensive audit trails for compliance and security monitoring. This provides visibility into authentication events and administrative actions across the hybrid environment.

1. **Multi-Region Directory Replication**: Configure AWS Managed Microsoft AD multi-region replication to provide disaster recovery capabilities and improved performance for geographically distributed users.

2. **AWS IAM Integration**: Implement AWS IAM roles for Active Directory users and groups to enable federated access to AWS Management Console and programmatic access to AWS services.

3. **Application Load Balancer Integration**: Deploy Application Load Balancer with authentication actions to provide single sign-on access to web applications using the managed directory.

4. **Amazon Connect Integration**: Integrate Amazon Connect contact center with the directory service to enable agent authentication and customer identity verification through Active Directory.

5. **Advanced Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement comprehensive monitoring using CloudWatch, AWS Config, and third-party SIEM solutions to detect and respond to identity-related security events across the hybrid environment.
