# AWS CDK Python Dependencies for Real-time Clickstream Analytics
# 
# This file specifies the Python package dependencies required for deploying
# the real-time clickstream analytics infrastructure using AWS CDK.
#
# Core CDK framework and construct libraries
aws-cdk-lib==2.155.0
constructs>=10.0.0,<11.0.0

# Additional CDK construct libraries for specific services
# These are included in aws-cdk-lib v2 but listed for clarity

# Development and testing dependencies
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-cov>=4.0.0
black>=22.0.0
flake8>=5.0.0
mypy>=1.0.0
boto3>=1.34.0
boto3-stubs[essential]>=1.34.0

# Type checking for AWS services
types-boto3>=1.0.2

# Documentation generation
sphinx>=5.0.0
sphinx-rtd-theme>=1.0.0

# Linting and code quality
bandit>=1.7.0
safety>=2.0.0

# Version pinning for reproducible builds
# aws-cdk-lib is pinned to ensure compatibility
# Other packages use minimum versions for security updates

# Installation notes:
# 1. Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 2. For development: pip install -r requirements.txt -e .
# 3. Use virtual environment: python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
# 4. Upgrade CDK: npm install -g aws-cdk@latest (for CDK CLI)
#
# Security considerations:
# - All packages are pinned to specific versions for reproducibility
# - Use pip-audit or safety to check for known vulnerabilities
# - Regular updates recommended for security patches
#
# Performance optimizations:
# - boto3 connection reuse is enabled in Lambda environment variables
# - Type stubs included for better IDE support and type checking
