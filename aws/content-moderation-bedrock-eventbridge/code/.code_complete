Terraform Infrastructure as Code generation completed for:
Building Intelligent Content Moderation with Amazon Bedrock and EventBridge

Generated files:
- terraform/versions.tf - Provider requirements and configuration
- terraform/variables.tf - Input variables with validation
- terraform/main.tf - Complete infrastructure resources
- terraform/outputs.tf - Output values for verification and integration
- terraform/lambda_functions/content_analysis.py - Content analysis Lambda function
- terraform/lambda_functions/workflow_handler.py - Workflow processing Lambda function

Infrastructure components included:
✅ S3 buckets for content storage (source, approved, rejected)
✅ EventBridge custom bus and routing rules  
✅ Lambda functions for content analysis and workflow processing
✅ IAM roles and policies with least privilege access
✅ SNS topic for notifications
✅ CloudWatch log groups for monitoring
✅ Bedrock Guardrails for enhanced content filtering
✅ S3 security configurations (encryption, versioning, public access block)

The infrastructure is production-ready and follows AWS best practices for:
- Security (encryption, IAM policies, network isolation)
- Monitoring (CloudWatch logs, SNS notifications)
- Cost optimization (serverless architecture, intelligent storage)
- Reliability (error handling, retry logic, dead letter queues)

Deploy with: terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
