# Container Vulnerability Scanning with ECR

## Problem

Organizations struggle with maintaining secure containerized applications due to the complexity of tracking vulnerabilities across multiple container images. Development teams often push container images without comprehensive security scanning, leaving applications exposed to known vulnerabilities, malware, and supply chain attacks. Manual vulnerability assessment processes are time-consuming and prone to human error, while existing security tools often fail to provide actionable insights for remediation priorities. This creates compliance gaps and increases the risk of security incidents in production environments.

## Solution

Implement an automated container image vulnerability scanning solution using Amazon ECR's enhanced scanning capabilities integrated with Amazon Inspector. This solution provides continuous monitoring of container images for both operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities, with automated scan triggers on image push events. Amazon Inspector leverages multiple vulnerability databases and provides detailed findings with remediation guidance, while ECR integration ensures seamless scanning without disrupting development workflows.

## Prerequisites

1. AWS account with ECR, Inspector, and CloudWatch permissions
2. AWS CLI v2 installed and configured (or AWS CloudShell)
3. Docker installed for building and pushing container images
4. Basic understanding of container security concepts and vulnerability management
5. Estimated cost: $0.10-0.50 per image scanned (Inspector pricing) + ECR storage costs

> **Note**: Enhanced scanning is billed through Amazon Inspector. Review pricing at https://aws.amazon.com/inspector/pricing/

> **Tip**: Implement vulnerability scanning early in your CI/CD pipeline to catch security issues before they reach production. Set up automated blocking of deployments when critical vulnerabilities are detected.

> **Warning**: Never push container images with known critical vulnerabilities to production. Establish clear policies for acceptable risk levels and ensure development teams understand security scanning results.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables
export AWS_REGION=$(aws configure get region)
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity \
    --query Account --output text)

# Generate unique identifiers for resources
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(aws secretsmanager get-random-password \
    --exclude-punctuation --exclude-uppercase \
    --password-length 6 --require-each-included-type \
    --output text --query RandomPassword)

# Set resource names
export ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME="vulnerable-app-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export SNS_TOPIC_NAME="ecr-vulnerability-alerts-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export EMAIL_ADDRESS="your-email@example.com"

# Create SNS topic for vulnerability alerts
aws sns create-topic --name "${SNS_TOPIC_NAME}"

# Store topic ARN
export SNS_TOPIC_ARN=$(aws sns get-topic-attributes \
    --topic-arn "arn:aws:sns:${AWS_REGION}:${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:${SNS_TOPIC_NAME}" \
    --query Attributes.TopicArn --output text)

echo "✅ Environment configured with repository: ${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create ECR Repository with Enhanced Scanning**:

   Amazon ECR's enhanced scanning integrates directly with Amazon Inspector to provide comprehensive vulnerability detection. This integration automatically scans images on push and provides continuous monitoring for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

   ```bash
   # Create ECR repository with scan on push enabled
   aws ecr create-repository \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true \
       --tags Key=Purpose,Value=VulnerabilityScanning \
       Key=Environment,Value=Demo
   
   # Store repository URI
   export ECR_REPOSITORY_URI=$(aws ecr describe-repositories \
       --repository-names "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --query 'repositories[0].repositoryUri' --output text)
   
   echo "✅ ECR repository created: ${ECR_REPOSITORY_URI}"
   ```

2. **Enable Amazon Inspector Enhanced Scanning**:

   Amazon Inspector Enhanced Scanning provides deeper vulnerability detection than basic ECR scanning, including support for programming language packages (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.) and more comprehensive OS package scanning.

   ```bash
   # Enable Inspector ECR scanning at the registry level
   aws inspector2 enable \
       --resource-types ECR \
       --account-ids "${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}"
   
   # Configure registry scanning configuration
   aws ecr put-registry-scanning-configuration \
       --scan-type ENHANCED \
       --rules '[{
           "scanFrequency": "CONTINUOUS_SCAN",
           "repositoryFilters": [{
               "filter": "*",
               "filterType": "WILDCARD"
           }]
       }]'
   
   echo "✅ Inspector enhanced scanning enabled for ECR"
   ```

3. **Configure Inspector Scan Settings**:

   The rescan duration setting determines how frequently Amazon Inspector re-evaluates container images for newly discovered vulnerabilities, even when the image hasn't changed. This continuous monitoring capability is essential for maintaining security posture over time, as new CVEs are published daily and previously clean images may become vulnerable. Setting a 30-day rescan duration balances security coverage with cost optimization, ensuring regular monitoring without excessive charges.

   ```bash
   # Set ECR re-scan duration to 30 days
   aws inspector2 update-configuration \
       --ecr-configuration '{
           "rescanDuration": "DAYS_30"
       }'
   
   # Verify Inspector configuration
   aws inspector2 get-configuration \
       --query 'ecrConfiguration.rescanDurationState'
   
   echo "✅ Inspector scanning configuration updated"
   ```

   This configuration ensures that your container images are continuously monitored for emerging threats, providing ongoing security assurance for long-running applications. The 30-day interval provides a good balance between security coverage and cost management, as detailed in the [Amazon Inspector User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/what-is-inspector.html).

4. **Create Sample Vulnerable Container Image**:

   This step creates a container image with intentionally outdated packages to demonstrate vulnerability detection capabilities. In real scenarios, vulnerabilities often come from outdated base images or dependencies.

   ```bash
   # Create directory for sample application
   mkdir -p vulnerable-app && cd vulnerable-app
   
   # Create Dockerfile with intentionally vulnerable packages
   cat > Dockerfile << 'EOF'
   FROM ubuntu:20.04
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
       curl \
       wget \
       apache2 \
       php7.4 \
       libssl1.1 \
       openssl \
       && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
   EXPOSE 80
   CMD ["apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND"]
   EOF
   
   # Build the container image
   docker build -t "${ECR_REPOSITORY_URI}:vulnerable-v1.0" .
   
   echo "✅ Sample vulnerable container image built"
   ```

5. **Authenticate and Push Image to ECR**:

   ECR authentication uses temporary tokens that provide secure access to your container registry without exposing permanent credentials. The authentication process generates a 12-hour token that Docker uses to authenticate with the ECR service. This approach follows AWS security best practices by avoiding long-lived credentials and ensuring access is properly audited through AWS CloudTrail.

   ```bash
   # Get ECR authentication token
   aws ecr get-login-password --region "${AWS_REGION}" | \
       docker login --username AWS --password-stdin \
       "${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}.dkr.ecr.${AWS_REGION}.amazonaws.com"
   
   # Push the image to ECR
   docker push "${ECR_REPOSITORY_URI}:vulnerable-v1.0"
   
   # Wait for push to complete
   sleep 30
   
   echo "✅ Container image pushed to ECR"
   ```

   The image push triggers automatic vulnerability scanning due to the scanOnPush configuration enabled earlier. ECR immediately begins the enhanced scanning process, leveraging Amazon Inspector's vulnerability database to identify potential security issues. This integration ensures that security scanning occurs seamlessly as part of your container deployment workflow, as described in the [ECR User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning-enhanced.html).

6. **Monitor Initial Scan Progress**:

   Amazon Inspector's scanning process analyzes both operating system packages and programming language libraries within your container images. The scanner compares installed packages against multiple vulnerability databases, including the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and vendor-specific security advisories. Scan findings are categorized by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) and include detailed remediation guidance to help development teams prioritize fixes.

   ```bash
   # Check scan status
   aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --image-id imageTag=vulnerable-v1.0 \
       --query 'imageScanStatus' || echo "Scan in progress..."
   
   # Get image details
   aws ecr describe-images \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --image-ids imageTag=vulnerable-v1.0 \
       --query 'imageDetails[0].imageScanFindingsSummary'
   
   echo "✅ Initial scan initiated"
   ```

   The scan results provide a comprehensive security assessment, including CVE identifiers, CVSS scores, and package-specific remediation advice. This detailed analysis enables security teams to make informed decisions about deployment risks and prioritize remediation efforts based on actual impact. Learn more about scan findings in the [ECR Image Scanning documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html).

7. **Create CloudWatch Alarms for High Severity Vulnerabilities**:

   CloudWatch alarms provide automated monitoring and alerting for security events, enabling rapid response to critical vulnerabilities. By setting threshold-based alerts on vulnerability severity levels, security teams can establish automated workflows that trigger immediate action when high-risk images are detected. This proactive monitoring approach helps maintain security compliance and reduces the time between vulnerability discovery and remediation.

   ```bash
   # Create metric filter for high severity findings
   aws logs create-log-group \
       --log-group-name "/aws/inspector/ecr-findings" \
       --retention-in-days 30
   
   # Create CloudWatch alarm for critical vulnerabilities
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
       --alarm-name "ECR-Critical-Vulnerabilities-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --alarm-description "Alert on critical vulnerabilities in ECR images" \
       --metric-name "CriticalVulnerabilities" \
       --namespace "AWS/Inspector" \
       --statistic Average \
       --period 300 \
       --threshold 1 \
       --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold \
       --evaluation-periods 1 \
       --alarm-actions "${SNS_TOPIC_ARN}"
   
   echo "✅ CloudWatch alarm created for critical vulnerabilities"
   ```

   The alarm configuration monitors Inspector metrics and triggers notifications when critical vulnerabilities are detected, enabling immediate response to security threats. This automation ensures that security teams are notified promptly about high-priority vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of deploying vulnerable images to production environments. For more information about CloudWatch alarms, see the [CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/AlarmThatSendsEmail.html).

8. **Set up EventBridge Rules for Scan Notifications**:

   Amazon EventBridge enables event-driven architecture by routing security events from Inspector to downstream systems for automated response. This decoupled approach allows multiple systems to react to vulnerability findings simultaneously, supporting complex workflows like ticket creation, deployment blocking, and compliance reporting. EventBridge's pattern matching capabilities ensure that only relevant security events trigger notifications, reducing noise and focusing attention on actionable findings.

   ```bash
   # Create EventBridge rule for Inspector findings
   aws events put-rule \
       --name "ECR-Vulnerability-Findings-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --description "Capture Inspector ECR vulnerability findings" \
       --event-pattern '{
           "source": ["aws.inspector2"],
           "detail-type": ["Inspector2 Finding"],
           "detail": {
               "service": ["ECR"]
           }
       }'
   
   # Add SNS target to the rule
   aws events put-targets \
       --rule "ECR-Vulnerability-Findings-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --targets "Id=1,Arn=${SNS_TOPIC_ARN}"
   
   # Grant EventBridge permission to publish to SNS
   aws sns add-permission \
       --topic-arn "${SNS_TOPIC_ARN}" \
       --label "EventBridge-Publish" \
       --aws-account-id "${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}" \
       --action-name "Publish"
   
   echo "✅ EventBridge rule configured for vulnerability notifications"
   ```

   The EventBridge rule captures Inspector vulnerability findings in real-time and routes them to SNS for notification distribution. This event-driven pattern enables scalable security response workflows and supports integration with external security tools and incident response systems. The rule's event pattern ensures that only ECR-related vulnerability findings trigger notifications, maintaining focus on container security events. Learn more about EventBridge patterns in the [EventBridge User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-get-started.html).

9. **Configure SNS Email Subscription**:

   Amazon SNS provides reliable, scalable notification delivery to multiple communication channels, ensuring security alerts reach the right stakeholders promptly. The fan-out messaging pattern allows single vulnerability findings to trigger notifications across multiple channels (email, SMS, Slack, etc.), supporting diverse team communication preferences. SNS's guaranteed delivery and retry mechanisms ensure critical security alerts are not lost, maintaining reliable security incident response.

   ```bash
   # Subscribe email to SNS topic
   aws sns subscribe \
       --topic-arn "${SNS_TOPIC_ARN}" \
       --protocol email \
       --notification-endpoint "${EMAIL_ADDRESS}"
   
   echo "✅ Email subscription created - please confirm the subscription"
   echo "Check your email for subscription confirmation"
   ```

   The email subscription requires confirmation to prevent unauthorized notifications and ensure legitimate stakeholders receive security alerts. SNS supports multiple subscription protocols including email, SMS, HTTP/HTTPS webhooks, and AWS Lambda functions, enabling flexible notification routing based on organizational needs. This multi-channel approach ensures security teams receive timely alerts regardless of their preferred communication method. For more information about SNS subscriptions, see the [SNS Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-getting-started.html).

10. **Create Enhanced Container Image with Fewer Vulnerabilities**:

    Container security hardening involves multiple layers of protection, including using recent base images, minimizing installed packages, applying security updates, and implementing proper user access controls. The secure image demonstrates best practices such as using a newer Ubuntu base image (22.04 vs 20.04), running apt-get upgrade to install security patches, removing unnecessary packages, and implementing non-root user execution. These practices significantly reduce the attack surface and potential vulnerability exposure.

    ```bash
    # Create improved Dockerfile
    cat > Dockerfile.secure << 'EOF'
    FROM ubuntu:22.04
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        curl \
        && apt-get upgrade -y \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
    RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash appuser
    USER appuser
    WORKDIR /home/appuser
    CMD ["sleep", "infinity"]
    EOF
    
    # Build and push the secure image
    docker build -f Dockerfile.secure -t "${ECR_REPOSITORY_URI}:secure-v1.0" .
    docker push "${ECR_REPOSITORY_URI}:secure-v1.0"
    
    echo "✅ Secure container image built and pushed"
    ```

    The secure image incorporates multiple security improvements: using a newer base image reduces known vulnerabilities, running apt-get upgrade applies the latest security patches, and implementing non-root user execution follows the principle of least privilege. These changes will be reflected in the vulnerability scan results, demonstrating how proactive security measures reduce risk exposure. This approach aligns with container security best practices outlined in the [ECR Best Practices Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_best_practices.html).

## Validation & Testing

1. **Verify Enhanced Scanning is Active**:

   ```bash
   # Check registry scanning configuration
   aws ecr get-registry-scanning-configuration \
       --query 'scanningConfiguration'
   
   # Verify Inspector is enabled
   aws inspector2 get-configuration \
       --query 'ecrConfiguration.rescanDurationState.status'
   ```

   Expected output: `"SUCCESS"` indicating Inspector is properly configured.

2. **Review Vulnerability Findings**:

   ```bash
   # Wait for scan completion (may take 5-10 minutes)
   sleep 300
   
   # Get detailed scan findings for vulnerable image
   aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --image-id imageTag=vulnerable-v1.0 \
       --query 'imageScanFindings.findingSeverityCounts'
   
   # List specific vulnerabilities
   aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --image-id imageTag=vulnerable-v1.0 \
       --query 'imageScanFindings.findings[?severity==`HIGH`].[name,description]' \
       --output table
   ```

   Expected output: Multiple vulnerabilities with severity counts and detailed findings.

3. **Compare Scan Results Between Images**:

   ```bash
   # Compare vulnerability counts between images
   echo "Vulnerable image findings:"
   aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --image-id imageTag=vulnerable-v1.0 \
       --query 'imageScanFindings.findingSeverityCounts'
   
   echo "Secure image findings:"
   aws ecr describe-image-scan-findings \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --image-id imageTag=secure-v1.0 \
       --query 'imageScanFindings.findingSeverityCounts'
   ```

4. **Test EventBridge Integration**:

   ```bash
   # Check EventBridge rule metrics
   aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
       --namespace "AWS/Events" \
       --metric-name "InvocationsCount" \
       --dimensions Name=RuleName,Value="ECR-Vulnerability-Findings-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --start-time "$(date -u -d '1 hour ago' +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)" \
       --end-time "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S)" \
       --period 300 \
       --statistics Sum
   ```

## Cleanup

1. **Delete Container Images**:

   ```bash
   # Delete all images in the repository
   aws ecr batch-delete-image \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --image-ids imageTag=vulnerable-v1.0 imageTag=secure-v1.0
   
   echo "✅ Container images deleted"
   ```

2. **Remove ECR Repository**:

   ```bash
   # Delete the ECR repository
   aws ecr delete-repository \
       --repository-name "${ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME}" \
       --force
   
   echo "✅ ECR repository deleted"
   ```

3. **Clean up EventBridge and CloudWatch Resources**:

   ```bash
   # Remove EventBridge rule targets
   aws events remove-targets \
       --rule "ECR-Vulnerability-Findings-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}" \
       --ids "1"
   
   # Delete EventBridge rule
   aws events delete-rule \
       --name "ECR-Vulnerability-Findings-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

       --topic-arn "${SNS_TOPIC_ARN}"
   
   echo "✅ SNS topic deleted"
   ```

5. **Disable Inspector (Optional)**:

   ```bash
   # Disable Inspector for ECR if no longer needed
   aws inspector2 disable \
       --resource-types ECR \
       --account-ids "${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}"
   
   echo "✅ Inspector ECR scanning disabled"
   ```

6. **Clean up Local Files**:

   ```bash
   # Remove local build directory
   cd .. && rm -rf vulnerable-app
   
   # Unset environment variables
   unset ECR_REPOSITORY_NAME SNS_TOPIC_NAME EMAIL_ADDRESS
   unset ECR_REPOSITORY_URI SNS_TOPIC_ARN
   
   echo "✅ Local cleanup completed"
   ```

## Discussion

This solution demonstrates a comprehensive approach to container image vulnerability scanning using AWS native services. Amazon Inspector's enhanced scanning capabilities provide deep visibility into both operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities, leveraging multiple CVE databases including the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and vendor-specific databases. The integration with Amazon ECR ensures that scanning occurs automatically whenever images are pushed, creating a security gate in the CI/CD pipeline.

The architecture supports both scan-on-push and continuous scanning modes, with continuous scanning providing ongoing monitoring as new vulnerabilities are discovered. This is particularly valuable for long-running applications where images may become vulnerable over time due to newly published CVEs. The solution also demonstrates the mapping of container images to running containers in ECS and EKS clusters, enabling teams to prioritize remediation based on actual usage patterns.

EventBridge integration enables real-time notifications and automated responses to vulnerability findings, while CloudWatch metrics provide visibility into security posture trends. The combination of these services creates a robust security monitoring system that can scale across multiple repositories and environments. Organizations can extend this pattern with additional automation, such as blocking deployments based on vulnerability severity thresholds or automatically creating tickets for remediation workflows.

## Challenge

Extend this solution by implementing these enhancements:

1. **Automated Remediation Workflows**: Create Lambda functions that automatically rebuild and push patched images when vulnerabilities are detected, integrating with your CI/CD pipeline to trigger updates.

2. **Vulnerability Scoring and Prioritization**: Implement custom scoring algorithms that consider factors like CVSS scores, exploit availability, and runtime context to prioritize remediation efforts.

3. **Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Connect vulnerability findings to AWS Security Hub and external SIEM systems for comprehensive security monitoring and incident response.

4. **Multi-Account Scanning Management**: Extend the solution to manage vulnerability scanning across multiple AWS accounts using AWS Organizations, with centralized reporting and policy enforcement.

5. **Container Runtime Security**: Integrate with AWS GuardDuty for EKS or third-party runtime security tools to correlate vulnerability findings with runtime behavior and threat detection.
