# Infrastructure Code Generation Complete

This directory contains complete Infrastructure as Code implementations for the "Building Real-Time Video Analytics with Rekognition and Kinesis" recipe.

## Generated Files

### Terraform Implementation
- `terraform/main.tf` - Main infrastructure resources
- `terraform/variables.tf` - Input variables and validation
- `terraform/outputs.tf` - Output values and next steps
- `terraform/versions.tf` - Provider requirements and configuration
- `terraform/analytics_processor.py` - Lambda function for processing analytics
- `terraform/query_api.py` - Lambda function for query API

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Comprehensive deployment and usage guide

## Features Implemented

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Kinesis Video Streams for video ingestion
- ✅ Amazon Rekognition face collection
- ✅ Kinesis Data Streams for analytics results
- ✅ DynamoDB tables for metadata storage
- ✅ Lambda functions for event processing
- ✅ SNS topic for security alerts
- ✅ API Gateway for REST queries

### Security Features
- ✅ KMS encryption for data at rest
- ✅ IAM roles with least privilege
- ✅ VPC-compatible configuration
- ✅ CloudWatch logging with encryption

### Advanced Features
- ✅ Real-time face recognition and matching
- ✅ Object and label detection processing
- ✅ Automated security alerting
- ✅ RESTful query API with filtering
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- ✅ Statistical analysis and reporting

### Operational Features
- ✅ Auto-scaling DynamoDB tables
- ✅ CloudWatch log retention policies
- ✅ Resource tagging for cost tracking
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Error handling and dead letter queues

## Deployment Status

✅ **Ready for Deployment**

The infrastructure code is complete and ready for deployment. All resources are properly configured with:
- Input validation for all variables
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security best practices
- Cost optimization features
- Production-ready configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Run `terraform apply` in the terraform directory
2. **Create Stream Processor**: Use AWS CLI to create and start Rekognition stream processor
3. **Add Face Data**: Index faces in the Rekognition collection for recognition
4. **Send Video**: Configure video sources to stream to Kinesis Video Streams
5. **Monitor Operations**: Set up CloudWatch dashboards and alerts

## Code Quality

- ✅ All Terraform code follows HCL best practices
- ✅ Lambda functions include comprehensive error handling
- ✅ API includes proper HTTP status codes and CORS
- ✅ Security configurations follow AWS Well-Architected principles
- ✅ Resource naming follows consistent patterns
- ✅ Documentation includes troubleshooting guides
