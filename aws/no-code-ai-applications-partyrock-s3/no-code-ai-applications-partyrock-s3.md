## Prerequisites

1. AWS account with appropriate permissions for S3 and CloudFront access
2. AWS CLI installed and configured (version 2.0 or later)
3. Basic understanding of static websites and content delivery networks
4. Social media account (Apple, Amazon, or Google) for PartyRock authentication
5. Estimated cost: $0.50-$2.00 per month for S3 storage and CloudFront distribution

> **Note**: PartyRock is a free Amazon Bedrock playground that offers daily free usage quotas and does not require an AWS account to get started with application development.

## Preparation

```bash
# Set environment variables
export AWS_REGION=$(aws configure get region)
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity \
    --query Account --output text)

# Generate unique identifiers for resources
RANDOM_SUFFIX=$(aws secretsmanager get-random-password \
    --exclude-punctuation --exclude-uppercase \
    --password-length 6 --require-each-included-type \
    --output text --query RandomPassword)

# Set bucket name and CloudFront distribution variables
export BUCKET_NAME="partyrock-app-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"
export DISTRIBUTION_NAME="partyrock-cdn-${RANDOM_SUFFIX}"

echo "✅ AWS environment configured for PartyRock application hosting"
echo "Bucket Name: ${BUCKET_NAME}"
echo "AWS Region: ${AWS_REGION}"
```

## Steps

1. **Create Your First PartyRock AI Application**:

   Amazon PartyRock is a no-code playground that leverages Amazon Bedrock's foundation models to create generative AI applications through natural language descriptions. The platform enables rapid prototyping of AI solutions without requiring programming expertise, making it accessible to business users, designers, and non-technical stakeholders who want to experiment with AI capabilities.

   ```bash
   # Navigate to PartyRock platform
   echo "Opening PartyRock platform..."
   echo "Visit: https://partyrock.aws/"
   
   # Sign in with your preferred social account
   echo "1. Click 'Sign in' and authenticate with Apple, Amazon, or Google"
   echo "2. Click 'Build your own app' from the main dashboard"
   echo "3. Enter description: 'Create a business name generator that \
   creates catchy names based on industry and target audience'"
   
   echo "✅ PartyRock application creation initiated"
   ```

   The PartyRock platform automatically generates widgets and configures AI models based on your description. This serverless approach eliminates the need for infrastructure management while providing access to powerful language models through Amazon Bedrock's managed service.

2. **Configure AI Application Widgets and Logic**:

   PartyRock applications are built using widgets that represent different AI capabilities such as text generation, image creation, and document processing. Each widget can reference other widgets through prompt chaining, enabling complex multi-step AI workflows that process user inputs through multiple AI models to produce sophisticated outputs.

   ```bash
   # Configure application widgets through PartyRock interface
   echo "Configuring application widgets..."
   
   # Widget 1: User Input Collection
   echo "1. Edit 'User Input' widget:"
   echo "   - Title: 'Business Information'"
   echo "   - Add fields for industry type and target audience"
   echo "   - Set placeholder text for user guidance"
   
   # Widget 2: AI Name Generation
   echo "2. Configure 'Text Generation' widget:"
   echo "   - Model: Claude 3 Haiku or Claude 3 Sonnet"
   echo "   - Prompt: Reference @Business Information widget"
   echo "   - Generate 5 creative business names with explanations"
   
   # Widget 3: Visual Branding
   echo "3. Add 'Image Generation' widget:"
   echo "   - Create logo concepts for generated names"
   echo "   - Reference generated names from previous widget"
   
   echo "✅ AI application widgets configured with prompt chaining"
   ```

   This widget-based architecture allows for modular development where each component handles specific AI tasks. The platform automatically manages the underlying API calls to Amazon Bedrock, handles error conditions, and provides real-time feedback during application development.

3. **Test and Refine Your AI Application**:

   ```bash
   # Test application functionality
   echo "Testing AI application..."
   
   # Test with sample inputs
   echo "1. Enter test data:"
   echo "   - Industry: 'Sustainable Technology'"
   echo "   - Target Audience: 'Environmentally conscious millennials'"
   
   echo "2. Click 'Generate' to test all widgets"
   echo "3. Review outputs for quality and relevance"
   
   # Refine prompts based on results
   echo "4. Iterate on widget prompts to improve outputs"
   echo "5. Test with multiple input combinations"
   
   echo "✅ AI application tested and refined"
   ```

4. **Create S3 Bucket for Static Website Hosting**:

   Amazon S3 provides highly durable object storage with 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability, making it ideal for hosting static websites that showcase your PartyRock applications. The bucket will serve as the foundation for your application's web presence, storing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and media files while supporting website hosting configuration.

   ```bash
   # Create S3 bucket for static website hosting
   aws s3 mb s3://${BUCKET_NAME} --region ${AWS_REGION}
   
   # Enable versioning for data protection
   aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
       --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME} \
       --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
   
   # Enable server-side encryption
   aws s3api put-bucket-encryption \
       --bucket ${BUCKET_NAME} \
       --server-side-encryption-configuration \
       'Rules=[{ApplyServerSideEncryptionByDefault:{SSEAlgorithm:AES256}}]'
   
   echo "✅ S3 bucket created with security and versioning enabled"
   ```

   The bucket configuration includes enterprise-grade security features like encryption at rest and versioning, ensuring your application assets are protected while maintaining the ability to roll back changes if needed.

5. **Configure S3 Static Website Hosting**:

   ```bash
   # Enable static website hosting
   aws s3 website s3://${BUCKET_NAME} \
       --index-document index.html \
       --error-document error.html
   
   # Create simple HTML page showcasing your PartyRock app
   cat > index.html << 'EOF'
