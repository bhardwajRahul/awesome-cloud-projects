# CDK Python Dependencies for Database Performance Monitoring with RDS Performance Insights
# This file specifies the Python package dependencies required for the CDK application

# AWS CDK Core Libraries (CDK v2)
aws-cdk-lib>=2.100.0,<3.0.0
constructs>=10.0.0,<11.0.0

# AWS CDK Specific Service Libraries (included in aws-cdk-lib for CDK v2)
# These are included for explicit documentation of services used:
# - aws-cdk.aws-rds (RDS database instances with Performance Insights)
# - aws-cdk.aws-lambda (Lambda functions for performance analysis)
# - aws-cdk.aws-s3 (S3 buckets for report storage)
# - aws-cdk.aws-sns (SNS topics for alerts)
# - aws-cdk.aws-events (EventBridge for automation)
# - aws-cdk.aws-events-targets (EventBridge targets)
# - aws-cdk.aws-iam (IAM roles and policies)
# - aws-cdk.aws-logs (CloudWatch logs)
# - aws-cdk.aws-cloudwatch (CloudWatch metrics and alarms)
# - aws-cdk.aws-ec2 (VPC, security groups, subnets)

# Python Standard Library Dependencies
# These are typically included with Python but listed for completeness:
# - json (JSON handling)
# - datetime (Date/time operations)
# - os (Environment variables)
# - decimal (Decimal arithmetic)

# Additional Dependencies for Lambda Function
# These are used within the Lambda function code:
# - boto3 (AWS SDK for Python - available in Lambda runtime)
# - botocore (AWS SDK core - available in Lambda runtime)

# Development Dependencies (optional)
# Uncomment these for development and testing:
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0
# black>=22.0.0
# flake8>=5.0.0
# mypy>=0.991
# boto3-stubs[rds,lambda,s3,sns,events,cloudwatch,iam,logs,ec2]

# CDK CLI (install globally)
# npm install -g aws-cdk

# Note: This requirements.txt is minimal for CDK v2 applications
# The aws-cdk-lib package includes all AWS service constructs
# For production use, consider pinning to specific versions
