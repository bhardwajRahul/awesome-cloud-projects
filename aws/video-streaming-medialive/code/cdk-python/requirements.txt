# Note: Version ranges are specified to ensure compatibility while allowing for patch updates
# The CDK library versions should remain compatible across minor versions within the same major version

# Platform-specific considerations:
# - These dependencies are compatible with Python 3.8+ 
# - For production deployments, consider pinning to specific versions
# - Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
# - Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches

# Installation command:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# For development installation with optional dependencies:
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# To create a locked requirements file for production:
# pip freeze > requirements.lock
