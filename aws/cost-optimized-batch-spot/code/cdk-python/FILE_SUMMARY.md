## Key Features

### Infrastructure Components
- **VPC**: Custom VPC with public and private subnets
- **ECR Repository**: Container registry with image scanning and lifecycle policies
- **IAM Roles**: Least privilege roles for Batch service, EC2 instances, and job execution
- **Security Groups**: Network security for batch instances
- **AWS Batch**: Compute environment, job queue, and job definition
- **CloudWatch**: Log group for job monitoring
- **S3 Bucket**: Storage for job artifacts with lifecycle policies

### Cost Optimization Features
- **Spot Instance Allocation**: Uses SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED strategy
- **Mixed Instance Types**: Supports multiple instance families (c5, m5, r5)
- **Intelligent Scaling**: Scales from 0 to 256 vCPUs based on demand
- **Bid Percentage**: Maximum 80% of On-Demand pricing
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic cleanup of old resources

### Fault Tolerance
- **Retry Strategy**: Automatic retry for Spot interruptions
- **Multiple AZs**: Deployment across multiple availability zones
- **Health Checks**: Container health monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of instance terminations

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Manual Deployment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cdk bootstrap
   cdk deploy
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/
   ```

4. **Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   ./cleanup.sh
   # or
   cdk destroy
   ```

## Stack Outputs

The deployed stack provides these outputs:
- ECR Repository URI
- Job Queue Name
- Job Definition Name
- Compute Environment Name
- S3 Bucket Name
- CloudWatch Log Group Name

## Architecture Highlights

The CDK stack creates a production-ready, cost-optimized batch processing infrastructure that:
- Automatically scales based on job demand
- Uses Spot instances for up to 90% cost savings
- Implements intelligent retry strategies for fault tolerance
- Provides comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Follows AWS security best practices
- Supports container-based batch applications

This implementation serves as a reference for deploying cost-effective batch processing solutions on AWS while maintaining reliability and operational excellence.
